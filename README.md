# SOLID Principles Examples in PHP
Some examples about SOLID Design Principles in PHP

# Single Responsibility Principle
This principle is about actors and high level architecture.
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

# Open Closed Principle 
This principle is about class design and feature extensions.
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


# Liskov Substitution Principle 
This principle is about subtyping and inheritance
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

# Interface Segregation Principle
This principle is about business logic to clients communication.
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

# Dependency Inversion Principle 
This principle wires up all other four principles in a single circle.
Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
